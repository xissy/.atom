This should automatically pick up the right version,\nas well as your `mocha.opts` settings.\n\nIf you don't have a `package.json` file, or if Mocha isn't installed locally,\nit will try to execute the global `mocha` command instead.\n\n### How does it work?\n\nTo run the selected test, it uses `--grep` on the test name.\nIn the case the name isn't unique enough, it might run a few other tests.\nIn practice we found this is not an issue, and you still get fast TDD feedback loops.\n\n### Settings\n\nIf you go to the settings pane, you can set the following values:\n\n- `Node binary path`: path to the `node` executable (*defaults to `/usr/local/bin/node`*).\n- `Text only`: remove any colors from the Mocha output (*defaults to `false`*).\n- `Show context information`: display extra information for troubleshooting (*defaults to `false`*).\n- `Options`: append given options always to Mocha binary  (*optional*).\n- `Options for Debug`: append given options to Mocha binary to enable debugging.\n- `Env`: environment variables, useful for specifying `NODE_ENV`, etc.\n\nYou can also change the style of the results window. Simply go to `Open Your Stylesheet` in the main menu, and add\n\n```css\n.mocha-test-runner .results {\n  font-size: 1.5em;\n}\n```\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/TabDigital/atom-mocha-test-runner/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/TabDigital/atom-mocha-test-runner","_id":"mocha-test-runner@0.4.2","_shasum":"62915b25aaf9f95793e2f783019a04002d2372fa","_resolved":"file:../d-115525-39736-e7vncp/package.tgz","_from":"../d-115525-39736-e7vncp/package.tgz"}
